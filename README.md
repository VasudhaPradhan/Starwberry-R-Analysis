# Strawberry Treatment Data Analysis in R

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete, reproducible data analysis workflow in **R** using real experimental data from a strawberry field trial.  
The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and result summarization.

The project was designed to showcase **practical R skills for agricultural and biological research**, with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and statistical rigor.

## 🧪 Experimental Background
- **Crop:** Strawberry  
- **Design:** One-factor experiment  
- **Treatments:** 9 nutrient and biostimulant treatments  
- **Observations:** Plant-level measurements across replications  
- **Traits analyzed:**  
  - Plant spread  
  - Number of leaves  
  - Crown diameter  
  - Days to first flowering  
  - Total flowers  
  - Days to first harvest  
  - Fruit length  
  - Fruit breadth  

Missing observations were retained and handled statistically to reflect real-world experimental conditions.

## 🔬 Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Converted multi-sheet Excel data into a single tidy dataset
   - Standardized structure and preserved missing values

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Boxplots to visualize biological variability
   - Mean ± SE plots for treatment comparison

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - One-way ANOVA for all traits
   - Tukey HSD post-hoc tests for significant traits

4. **Results Summary**
   - Automated identification of best treatments per trait
   - Exported concise results table

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Significant treatment effects were observed for most yield and quality traits.
- Different treatments optimized different traits, highlighting trade-offs between growth, yield, quality, and earliness.
- The workflow is fully reproducible and easily extensible to more complex experimental designs.
